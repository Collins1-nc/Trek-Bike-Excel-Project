# Trek-Bike Excel Project 

### Project Overview

Trek-Bike Corporation, a leading manufacturer and seller bicycles, catering to a diverse market across the United States and internationally. The company’s mission is to promote sustainable, healthy transportation solutions through high-quality bicycles. Trek-Bike Corporation offers a range of products, from road bikes and mountain bikes to electric and hybrid models, designed for both recreational and professional use.

The primary objective is to analyze and segment Trek-Bike's customer base to better understand the average income of married people who purchased bikes, home owners who purchased bikes, the commute distance of customers who purchased bikes, age category of customers that purchased bikes, occupation, education of customers who purchased bikes, among many others. This will enable Trek-Bike Corporation to optimize marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction, ultimately driving revenue growth.

Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Trek-Bike raw data" Excel file, containing detailed information about the bike buyers in Trek-Bike Corporation.

Tools

Microsoft Excel – Data Cleaning & Visualization

Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the Initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
Data Import and Structure Review.
Correcting Inconsistent or Incorrect Data.
Removing irrelevant cells and colours.
Handling missing and duplicate values.
Data cleaning, transformation and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved in exploring the Trek-Bike raw data to answer key questions, such as:

1.	What is the average income and marital status of buyers that purchased bikes and those that did not?
2.	How many home owners purchased bikes compared to none home owners?
3.	Based on the distance, show the customers that purchased highest and lowest number of bikes?
4.	What age category purchased the highest and lowest number of bikes?
5.	Bring forth the insights and analysis from the customers’ educational qualifications and occupations

Key Data Points

The project will focus on analyzing the following customer data:
- 	Gender: Understanding the gender breakdown of Trek-Bike buyers to identify the gender that purchases the bike more and improve targeted marketing efforts.
-   Income: Income data helps determine customer purchasing power and tailor product offerings and pricing strategies to different income segments.
-   Education: Education level can reveal lifestyle patterns and preferences that may influence bike choices
-   Occupation: Insights into buyers' professions can help identify segments, such as Professionals or Skilled personnel, who may have unique commuting or recreational needs.
-   Home Ownership: Knowing if buyers are homeowners versus renters can provide insights into their lifestyle and potential storage space availability for bikes.
-   Commute Distance: This data will inform Trek-Bike Corporation on the types of bikes customers need, as shorter distances may favor standard or hybrid bikes, while longer distances might indicate demand for electric models.
-   Region: Regional data allows for targeted marketing based on climate, needs, terrain, and biking culture in different areas.
-   Age Category: Age segmentation enables Trek-Bike to cater to different age groups, from younger, adventurous cyclists to older, health-conscious riders and their level of purchase.

Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
-	The average income of Married customers who purchased bike is $60,346 compared to Married customers that did not purchase bikes with average income of $57,492, also, the average income of Single customers who purchased bikes is $55,760 compared to Single customers that did not purchase bike, $51,085.
-	There are more males who purchased bikes than the females with a slight difference.
-	There are 325 home owners who purchased bikes compared to 358 home owners that did not purchase bikes, also, there are 156 none home owners that purchased bikes compared to 161 none home owners that did not purchase bike.
-	Those whose commute distance ranges from 0-1 miles purchased the highest number of bikes (200) while those with commute distance above 10 miles have the lowest purchase (78).
-	North America is the region with the highest number of purchase (220).
-	Customers with Bachelors Degree and customers with professional occupation are those with highest numbers of bike purchase. 
-	Adults (31 – 40 years) in the age category, purchased more bikes than any other age category with Elderly Adults (71 years and above) as the least age category that purchased bikes.  

Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
-	Trek-Bike Corporation should increase their online presence through the use of social media and advertisements in other part of the world, this will increase sales and revenue.
-	Young Adults are the second largest bike buyer of the company in terms of age category, I recommend that some promotions and discount be made for this age category in order to make huge sales from them, they are the largest number of customers that have priced the products.
-	I recommend payment by instalment as this will attract more buyers and increase sales.
